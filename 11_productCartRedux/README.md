# Cart Management Project Using Redux and React-Redux

This project cannot be described as there are too many things involved but majority has already been discussed. This project simply demonstrates how to integrate **redux** with our **react application** and along with it you get to know 2 hooks that are primariliy used. One is the `useSelector` to get the data and one is `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.

You also need too wrap the entire thing in a provider and pass the `store` to that provider so that every component has access to it.
